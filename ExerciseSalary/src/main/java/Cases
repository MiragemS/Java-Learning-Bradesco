Case 1
- Let's imagine that in a selection process there is a base salary value of 2000 reais and the
salary desired by the candidate. Let's create a flow control where:
  1 - if the base value is greater than the desired salary value, print: "call candidate"
  2 - Otherwise, if the base salary value is equal to the desired salary value, print: Call the
  candidate with a counter proposal
  3 - Otherwise, print: awaiting results from other candidates

Case 2
Our system was asked to ensure that, given the numerous applications, only 5 candidates are
selected for interview where the desired salary is less than or equal to the base salary.

Case 3
Now it's time to print the list of selected candidates to make it available for HR to contact

Case 4
HR must make a call with a maximum of 03 attempts to the selected candidate and if the candidate
 answers, the following must be printed:
- "We were able to contact [candidate] after [attempted] attempts

-otherwise, print: "We were unable to contact the [candidate]"
